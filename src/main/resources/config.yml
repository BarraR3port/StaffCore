# For using this, you will need to have enabled the mysql otherwise it won't work and may show up some errors
# This is meant to notify all your StaffMembers about the Ban Alerts, Report Alerts, and so on.
# The Mysql is needed cuz that's where the plugin is going to get all the data like: the reason, the name...

# ------------> DISCORD <--------------
# If you have a discord and you want to implement webhooks with StaffCore, change it to true.
# There are two different channels that StaffCore handles, the Alerts Channel & Debug Channel.
# In the Alerts Channel, all the alerts will be sent to that channel, like bans, reports, etc.
# In the Debug Channel, everything that happens in the plugin will be sent to that Channel, for exp:
# If a player change his GameMode, or if a player kills another. (THIS IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT, MORE STUFF SOON)
# Now, How to implement this?, Easy, just Create a Channel > Edit Channel > Integrations > WebHooks > New WebHook >
# Copy WebHook URL and pasted into each Type.
